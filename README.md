# Problem Set 3.0
## List Processing 

### Directions
1. Fork and clone this lab
2. Run `npm install` to load project dependencies.
3. Complete coding exercises in the `exercises.js` file. (You will find the questions in `problem-set.md` and unit tests in `exercises.test.js`)
4. Test your code often by running `npm test`.
5. Check for style by running `./node_modules/.bin/eslint exercises.js` in the terminal.

   **Note:** You are not done with your exercises until all tests pass and there are no eslint errors.

9. When you are done, push your final commits and open a PR.
